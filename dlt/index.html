      <h4>Mission</h4>
      <p>
        Luxemburg-Casco School District will implement and integrate technology
        to enrich learning so that students have the knowledge and skills to be
        productive members of our global society.  We will provide educators
        with the technology resources, tools and knowledge necessary to create
        an environment for students that is conducive to the development of
        lifelong learning skills.
      </p>

      <h4>Vision</h4>
      <p>
        Luxemburg-Casco School District is committed to a future that
        enriches the lives of all students with the values, skills and work
        ethic necessary to navigate the ever-changing world of tomorrow. Our
        educators, students, families and community have always worked together
        to support the development of all students and provide a school
        environment that stimulates, engages and provides opportunities for
        creative, collaborative, and meaningful learning experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Schools are challenged to prepare students for the complex demands of
        the 21st Century. As digital citizens, our students will be expected to
        communicate, gather information, collaborate, and problem-solve in a
        global virtual environment. 1:1 technology allows the Luxemburg-Casco
        School District community the opportunity to enhance the skills of all
        students that are necessary to compete, thrive and lead an
        ever-changing world. We are therefore entering into a technology
        initiative that will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Allow for the all-encompassing use of technology by teachers,
          students, staff and administration to allow for individualized
          instruction and self-directed learning;
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare students with the skill set of the 21st Century Learner and
          Professional, regardless of socioeconomic status;
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare students to compete in a global society;
        </li>
        <li>
          Engage students in a medium with which they are familiar;
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow students to create content which will demonstrate a deeper
          understanding of the curriculum with which they are engaged;
        </li>
        <li>
          Promote student abilities in critical analyzation of multiple
          resources on the same topic; drawing a conclusion based upon the
          various information and defending their position on the topic
        </li>
